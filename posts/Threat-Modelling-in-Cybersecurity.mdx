*Threat modelling* is a process that enables cybersecurity professionals to identify and evaluate potential risks and vulnerabilities in networks, applications, and systems. This academic paper provides a comprehensive review of threat modelling in cybersecurity, including the importance of this process, methodologies for applying it, and specific applications within the field. Additionally, the paper explores future developments in the field of threat modelling and their potential impact on the cybersecurity landscape.

Threat modelling is an important process in cybersecurity that helps organizations to identify potential *risks and vulnerabilities* so that they can be addressed before a cyber attack occurs. This paper will provide a comprehensive review of threat modelling in cybersecurity, including the importance of this process, methodologies for applying it, real-world applications of the process, and potential future developments in the field.

Threat modelling is needed because it helps organizations to proactively identify potential threats and vulnerabilities and take steps to address them before a cyber attack occurs. This process can help to reduce cybersecurity risks, protect sensitive information, prevent financial losses, and preserve a company's reputation. It also helps organizations to comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to data privacy and security.

### How can Threat Modelling be Applied?

Threat modelling can be applied using various methodologies, such as STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege), DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability), and PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis). These methodologies differ in their approach and scope, but they all share the same objective of identifying and evaluating potential threats and vulnerabilities in an organization's assets.

### Applications of Threat Modelling:

Threat modelling can be applied to various aspects of cybersecurity, such as cloud computing, industrial control systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT). For example, threat modelling can be used to evaluate the cybersecurity risks associated with IoT devices, which often lack standardization and pose unique risks compared to traditional computing assets. Threat modelling can also be used to evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with industrial control systems, which are critical infrastructure components that are often targeted by cyber attackers.

Future developments in threat modelling are likely to focus on the integration of threat modelling into the software development lifecycle, the development of new methodologies for evaluating cybersecurity risks, and the application of machine learning and other technologies to improve the accuracy and efficiency of threat modelling.

To sum up, threat modelling is a critical process in cybersecurity that enables organizations to identify and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities in their assets proactively. By using a structured approach, such as the methodologies discussed above, organizations"
